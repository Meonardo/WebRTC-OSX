## WebRTC Binaries for macOS
This repository contains unofficial distribution of WebRTC framework binaries for macOS.

Since version M80, Google has [deprecated](https://groups.google.com/g/discuss-webrtc/c/Ozvbd0p7Q1Y/m/M4WN2cRKCwAJ?pli=1) their mobile binary libraries distributions (Was officially using the [GoogleWebRTC pod](https://cocoapods.org/pods/GoogleWebRTC)). To get the most up to date WebRTC library, you can compile it on your own, or you can use precompiled binaries from other sources.

## ðŸ“¦ Releases
The binary releases correspond with official Chromium releases and branches as specified in the [Chromium dashboard](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/branches).

## ðŸ’¡ Things to know
* The building scripts are based on [Stasel' repo](https://github.com/stasel/WebRTC).
* All binaries in this repository are compiled from the official WebRTC [source code](https://webrtc.googlesource.com/src/).
* Dynamic framework (xcframework format) which contains binaries for arm64, x86 and x86_x64.
* Bitcode is included and this is the reason for the larger file size.

## ðŸšš Installation
